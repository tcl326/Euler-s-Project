# For any positive integer n, the nth weak Goodstein sequence {g1, g2, g3, ...}
# is defined as:
#
#   g_1 = n
#   for k > 1, g_k is obtained by writing g_k-1 in base k,
#   interpreting it as a base k + 1 number, and subtracting 1.
#
# The sequence terminates when gk becomes 0.
#
# For example, the 6th weak Goodstein sequence is {6, 11, 17, 25, ...}:
#   g1 = 6.
#   g2 = 11 since 6 = 110 base 2, 110 base 3 = 12, and 12 - 1 = 11.
#   g3 = 17 since 11 = 102 base 3, 102 base 4 = 18, and 18 - 1 = 17.
#   g4 = 25 since 17 = 101 base 4, 101 base 5 = 26, and 26 - 1 = 25.
#   and so on.
#
#  It can be shown that every weak Goodstein sequence terminates.
#
#  Let G(n) be the number of nonzero elements in the nth weak Goodstein sequence.
#  It can be verified that G(2) = 3, G(4) = 21 and G(6) = 381.
#  It can also be verified that Sum(G(n)) = 2517 for 1 <= n < 8.
#
#  Find the last 9 digits of Sum(G(n)) for 1 <= n < 16
